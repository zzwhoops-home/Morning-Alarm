# Morning Alarm

Shelved project.

Originally, this project sought to create a morning alarm that would go off at preset intervals, using a 15.ai API or Google TTS to brief me on the day like how Tony Stark wakes up to JARVIS.
Unfortunately, I couldn't change the lightbulbs in my room to use Philips Wiz lighting.

Thanks to: https://github.com/wafflecomposite/15.ai-Python-API/blob/master/fifteen_api.py
It is the fifteen_api.py file you see in the code.
